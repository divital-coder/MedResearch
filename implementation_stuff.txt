In implementation details I think best to describe problems you already know so about different ways one can represent spatial metadata that images may have different orientations that still some datasets are in old standard that arrays may be row or column oriented; that sometimes orientation is described by matrix sometimes using quaternions ; that information about origin may be in this mateix or separately; that while modifying image we can modify both pixel array and metadata or just one of them and all has some utility; that a lot of tags in dicom are not well documented and different from equipment vendor to equipment vendor which sometimes require different handling ; if you want I can help you make some vulisualizations that will show how viewer shows images incorrectly when spatial data is incorrect; and how overlaying images of different modalities will be erroneous in this case
Yes itk , you can mention also nibabel monai dicom to nifti .. to stress that problem is complicated hence a lot of tools
